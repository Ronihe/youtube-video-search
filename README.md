The app allows you to search for a list of 12 YouTube videos per page
Pagination for the list of displayed videos
You can click on one of those videos to watch it
After you click on the one of videos, you will get redirect to another page( using react router)
The app has tests verifying it's functionality ( you donâ€™t have to do a high coverage because you only have limited time, as long as your tests cover some reducers, components and actions. That would be fine)
No CSS libraries allowed
